A **cool** repository for my class code.

  **'aha'** Moments
>1. In the terminal, what is 'cd' means, and how to find the file location in the terminal using 'ls'
>2. how to use GitHub
>3. the different language between GitHub coding and Visual Studio Coing

  **Two things** that are still **unclear**
>1. What is the differntiate between Basic system operation content and Fundamental Frontend content

 **9/19 Thursday** 
 **Three things** that I learned 
>1. I learned about the role of github, how it works in the working environment between workers
>2. I learned how to fine my file, my location, and how to update my new code that I made in Visual Studio Code in the github
>3. some basic process of javascript 

 **Two things** that I'm confusing
>1. The interface of the Visual Studio Code is still not familiar with me, everytime I try to open a new file in it, I don't know how to open it.
>2. Using terminal and changeing something in my computer is a little bit hard for me

 **word** for how I heel
>**Painful**


> there might have some changes
