 **9/19 Thursday** 
 **Three things** that I learned 
>1. I learned about the role of github, how it works in the working environment between workers
>2. I learned how to fine my file, my location, and how to update my new code that I made in Visual Studio Code in the github
>3. some basic process of javascript 

 **Two things** that I'm confusing
>1. The interface of the Visual Studio Code is still not familiar with me, everytime I try to open a new file in it, I don't know how to open it.
>2. Using terminal and changeing something in my computer is a little bit hard for me

 **word** for how I heel
>**Painful**


> there might have some changes


 **Three things** that I'm confusing
>1. I'm a little bit confusing the usage of '{}' and '[]'.
>2. I understand 'if' statement and how it works, but I don't know when it uses.
>3. I'm a little bit confusing the terms which are used in 'Javascript' because English is my second languge so that sometimes I don't know what the word stans for.

 **3 things** you feel like you have a solid understanding of

>1. Now, I know about the basic system of Javascript how it works.
>2. If there is some arrors in my code, I can find out by myself.
>3. Untill week 3, the class was fast for me to abstract all information in class, but now I can easily follow instruction.
